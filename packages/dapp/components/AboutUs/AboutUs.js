      <p className={styles.description}>
        We are a developer's bridge from web2 to web3.
        As we see Ethereumâ€™s body grow, we need the head to get bigger too. The issue at hand is that while there are millions of exceptionally skilled and experienced senior developers out there, senior Solidity developers remain scarce. We seek out to solve this imbalance and flip the supply deficiency by combining our forces and knowledge. With the right incentives, we can rapidly transform senior developers into senior Solidity developers.
      </p>
      <h3 className={styles.title}>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
      <p className={styles.description}>

       Mentors come to the DAO with mentorship proposals, interview prospects and pick their trainees. We act as a meeting place and provide incentives to jump-start a rapid two-month mentoring program.
      At the end of the process, new Ethereum engineers will arise who in return one day will be able to mentor new trainees. 
     </p>
      <p className={styles.description}>
      We do not charge mentees for their trainings, we actually give them the possibility to ask for funds to cover the non-paid time they put in. All of our funding comes from donations. If you see value in what we do, go ahead and <a href="#donate">mint an NFT!</a>
     </p>
