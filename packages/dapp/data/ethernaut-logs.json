Our farmland lies fallow, the water is contaminated, all soil eroded. Terraforming efforts are suppressed by the aggressive, mutated fauna. Any efforts for knowledge and information transfers are suppressed and censored, movements for sustainability crushed with no mercy. Humanity is going extinct."

These are the true Ethernauts, capable of unimaginable advancements. But there are few of us. We need to inspire more wayfarers for our cause. Teaming up and coordination are our number one tools. The breakthrough is near, I can feel it in the air."

I need to figure out how to travel there. It’s the opportunity of our lifetime. There are so many and we're just a few Ethernauts so far. We need to be more!"

    "text": "Even though the research consumes all my time, my hope grows day by day. The Ethernauts were able to coordinate and develop a hyperspace jump drive. We are building from different locations, and we understood a powerful gateway is necessary to run it. An optimistic gateway is our best bet. It is closely guarded by some of the best and whitelisting is hard. It must be opened. They will understand, they must or we are doomed. The rift we can open with their technology will allow us 10.000 jumps!"

He also made some adjustments to our warping system. Rumour has it he already warped to WEB3 in an earlier iteration and secretly conceived this alloy, but we will never know for sure. He just comes and goes like a younger version of Gandalf."

Their departure is set X days before D-Day, in order to establish the first lifeline to the new world.

The gateway is stable and we can now invite all WEB2 inhabitants to move over to the WEB3 galaxy. Our readings show more than 10,000 habitable planets to explore. It is your responsibility to create a safer environment for all mankind. Remember, you need fuel for this journey, pick as much as you want. Remember excess fuel gets donated to EthernautDAO to train future generations of Ethernauts! Good Luck!"
